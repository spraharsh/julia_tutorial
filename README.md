For criticism see

1. For Jax vs Julia see [this post](https://kidger.site/thoughts/jax-vs-julia/) by Patrick Kidger.
2. If you're trying to compose together something novel, be careful about [correctness issues](https://yuri.is/not-julia/) (although personally I haven't encountered these, because I haven't tried putting packages together in novel ways).
